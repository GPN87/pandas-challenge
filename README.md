#Pandas project
This repo contains a jupyter notebook analysis of two .csv files that store hypothetical schools and students data. The anaylsis in the notebook has been done as a module assignment for the Data Analytics and Visualisation bootcamp I am doing.

DataFrames of interest include: 

A headline summary of school and student data for the entire local government area;
A count and mean of student metrics for each school;
The top five schools on the measure of overall passing rate;
The bottom five schools on the measure of overall passing rate;
Average math scores for each school separated by year group;
Average reading scores for each school separated by year group;
Average student results separated by per-student budget
Average student results separated by school size
Average student results separated by school type (government or independent)

From these extrapolations, we can conclude:

A school's per-student spend does not appear to impact student results. In fact the 'overall pass' rate was the lowest amongst students in the highest spending bracket.

School size on the other hand does appear to be associated with student results. Specifically, small and medium schools show greater passing rates than those of larger schools in maths, english and overall - by a number of percentage points.

## How to run
